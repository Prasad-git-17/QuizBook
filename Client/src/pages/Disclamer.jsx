        This app includes a custom quiz creation feature designed especially for teachers.
         By logging in as an admin, teachers can easily create, edit, and manage 
         subject-specific quizzes for their students. This makes it ideal for 
         conducting quick assessments, practice sessions, or revision tests. 
         The admin panel is simple to use, and requires no technical expertise â€”
          helping teachers save time and make learning more interactive.
